## Population in Navarre

In this map I'm going to show all villages in my region with it's name, post code and population.

First we will load libraries:

```{r libs}
library(leaflet)
```

First we load an csv file with the info

```{r load}
data = read.csv("2884bsc - 2.csv", header = FALSE, sep=";")

head(data)
```

I this csv first row is post code, second row is village name, fifth row is population and sixth and seventh rows are lat and lng. 

Now we will preprocess data to be able to load it the map.

```{r process}
lat = as.numeric(unlist(data[6]))
lng = as.numeric(unlist(data[7]))

names <- paste(data[,2], data[,1], data[,5], sep=" ")
```

Finally we can print the map.

```{r map, echo = FALSE}
Sys.Date()
df %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(popup = names)
```
